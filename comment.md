- We need a readme with requirements.txt giving instructions on installation of packages. I'm getting errors when I try to run it myself probably due to version differences
- typo "draft" 
- I would not call the orientation moving to the correct heading direction based on magnetometer "drifting"
- add instructions on how to add the IMU-visualizer also in the readme
- is the last cell to be moved to notebook 3?
